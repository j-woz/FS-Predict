# FS-Predict

== 🚀 Server Setup

Start the prediction server using a pre-trained models (for example MLPRegressor()) and associated scaler:

[source, bash]
----
python server.py -m usejoblib -k saved_state=../saved_models/mlp_model.pkl -k scaler_path=../saved_models/scaler.pkl -s ../tmp/sus/sock.s
----

=== 🔍 Parameter Details

* `-m usejoblib`  
  Loads the `usejoblib.py` module from the `models/` directory to serve predictions.

* `-k saved_state=../saved_models/mlp_model.pkl`  
  Path to the saved MLP model serialized with `joblib`.

* `-k scaler_path=../saved_models/scaler.pkl`  
  Path to the saved `MinMaxScaler` used during model training.

* `-s ../tmp/sus/sock.s`  
  Unix domain socket file path for server-client communication.

== 🔁 Model Retraining (Client Command)

Retrain the model on a new dataset such as `lambda.csv`:

[source, bash]
----
python client.py -s ../tmp/sus/sock.s insert -i lambda.csv
----

=== 🔍 Parameter Details

* `-s ../tmp/sus/sock.s`  
  Path to the server's Unix socket.

* `insert`  
  Client command to trigger model retraining.

* `-i lambda.csv`  
  Input file containing new training data. This file must include the `DURATION` column and other I/O fields.

== 📈 Prediction Mode (Client Command)

Send workload logs to the server and receive predicted durations:

[source, bash]
----
python client.py -s ../tmp/sus/sock.s predict -i workload.csv -o predicted.csv
----

=== 🔍 Parameter Details

* `-s ../tmp/sus/sock.s`  
  Path to the server’s Unix socket.

* `predict`  
  Client command to initiate prediction.

* `-i workload.csv`  
  Input CSV file with the columns: `TIMESTAMP`, `DY`, `HR`, `MN`, `OP`, `BYTES`. No `DURATION` column is required here.

* `-o predicted.csv`  
  Output file that receives predictions as: `<TIMESTAMP>,<PREDICTED_DURATION>`

== 📝 Notes

* Model and scaler must be saved using `joblib.dump()` before being loaded by the server.
